## My process

I started with creating custom variables for all necessary components. Then moved on to general styling of the layout, padding by using combination of grid (main container) and flex (individual containers).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Mostly how to style elements using media queries in a way so that I don't have to create queries for both desktop and mobile, and only for either or. I also learned to create grid components and position them with less code. As well as further increase my understanding of writing more efficient code.

### Continued development

Use of media queries as well as using grid and flex for what I need them to and not just to use them without knowing the reason why.
